Little Red Riding Hood is on her way to her grandmother&#39;s house. Her mother has warned her to stay on the path and not talk to strangers.   As she walks through the woods, she comes to a fork in the path. What should she do?
[[Stay on the main path, which is long and safe]]
[[Take the dark path.|Go down the small, dark path, which is shorter]]

Little Red Riding Hood chose the main path. It was a beautiful day, and she felt happy. Suddenly, a big wolf came out from behind a tree.

&quot;Hello, little girl,&quot; the wolf said with a friendly smile. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

Little Red Riding Hood remembered her mother&#39;s words. She was not supposed to talk to strangers.

What should Little Red Riding Hood do now?
[[She talks to the wolf and tells him where she is going]]
[[She ignores the wolf and continues walking fast.|Arrive at Grandmother&#39;s House.]](display: "inventory")</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Go down the small, dark path, which is shorter" tags="" position="400,375" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;images/Dark Path.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Descripción&quot; class=&quot;flotante&quot;/&gt;
Little Red Riding Hood thought the shorter path would be more exciting. She walked deeper into the forest. The trees were big and the sun could not reach the ground. She was starting to feel a little scared.

Suddenly, she saw some beautiful flowers growing far from the path.

Near the flowers, there was a stick  on the ground. It may break easily, but it might be useful in the future.

What should Little Red Riding Hood do?

[[She goes to pick the flowers for her grandmother.]]

Little Red Riding Hood finally arrived at her grandmother&#39;s house. The door was open. &quot;Grandmother?&quot; she called. There was no answer. She went inside and saw her grandmother in bed, wearing a nightcap.

The Little Red Riding Hood found a stick on the ground. She decided to pick it up, thinking it might be useful.

The wolf told Little Red Riding Hood, &quot;I know a faster way to your grandmother&#39;s house.&quot; He pointed to a small, hidden trail. &quot;Follow this path, and I will meet you there. It&#39;s a special shortcut.&quot;

What should Little Red Riding Hood do?

[[She follows the wolf&#39;s directions and takes the new path.]]
[[She says &quot;No, thank you&quot; and stays on the main road.]](display: "inventory")</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="She goes to pick the flowers for her grandmother." tags="" position="525,625" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;images/3.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;flotante&quot;&gt;
After Little Red Riding Hood stopped for the flowers, she met the wolf. &quot;What beautiful flowers!&quot; he said. &quot;Are you going to your grandmother&#39;s house? I know a shortcut.&quot; The wolf pointed to a different path.

What should Little Red Riding Hood do?

&quot;Hello, Grandmother. I brought you some food,&quot; she said.

The figure in the bed looked strange. Its nose was long and its ears were big. The figure said in a strange, deep voice, &quot;Come closer, my dear, so I can see you.&quot;
